TODO
====
	- 	Method of handling start of variable memory reset.

	- 	Carry on with variable coding.
		
	- 	Why won't XEMU work with RAM < $8000 ? Copying !!!! This is okay for now.



			consider set/get locals def fn options.

Fixes
=====

- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add Break Check to main RUN loop.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended and 65816
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
-	FP guard byte on subtract ? If so can uprate the accuracy test.

Error Checks
============

- 	Allocating temporary string memory (space available)
