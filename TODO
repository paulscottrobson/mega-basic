TODO
====
	- 	Why won't XEMU work with RAM < $8000 ? Copying !!!! This is okay for now.

	- 	Mega65 switch to (zp),Z, 65816 option of [xxxx],y, test 65C02 on 65816 (?)			
	 
	- 	Design and implement variables optional defaults and # (real) % (int) $ (string)
			consider set/get locals def fn options.

Fixes
=====

- 	Make 65816, Mega65 pointer code (both currently simple 6502)
-	Make 4510 PEEK correct (currently 6502 type)
- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add Break Check to main RUN loop.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended and 65816
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
-	FP guard byte on subtract ? If so can uprate the accuracy test.

Error Checks
============

- 	Allocating temporary string memory (space available)
