TODO
====
	- 	Optimise compare - can use signs and mantissas before subtracting - check expression, next.
	- 	LIST indenting.
	- 	ON GOTO/GOSUB

	- 	Why won't XEMU work with RAM < $8000 ? Copying !!!! This is okay for now.
			NEW OLD and Editing will not work (!)

	- 	Decide what to do next 
			- garbage collection
			- program editing.
			- method of setting default type.
			- rest of the commands :) 
								  READ DATA RESTORE (restore on reset)
								  DEF FN make it work ???
								  GET
									  
			- implement POS and TAB which I forgot about.
			- taylor functions. (Can MS copyright constants and known functions....)
			- square root N/R or LOG/EXP ? Seperate SQRT ?
			
	-	How will PROC work ? Pre-scan ? Store on search in quasi-type ?
	- 	Code reviews ?						
	- 	Add a proper vector for input/print
							  	
Fixes
=====

- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended and 65816
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
-	FP guard byte on subtract ? If so can uprate the floating point equality test.
-	fpch doesn't work in xemu or fm65 modes.

Error Checks
============

LoMem/HiMem crossover :)

- 	Allocating temporary string memory (space available)
- 	Allocating variable space.
- 	Allocating memory space for arrays.
- 	Stack Frame Push.
