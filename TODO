Fixes
=====

- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add Break Check to main RUN loop.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended and 65816
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
-	FP guard byte on subtract ? If so can uprate the floating point equality test.
-	fpch doesn't work in xemu or fm65 modes.

Error Checks
