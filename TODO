TODO
====
	-	Write search code for pre-existing variables.

	- 	Create empty array structures according to set specification,
		which is defaulted to (10) when unspecified but can be specified.

	- 	Fix var dump to show these.

	-	Add code to extract variables in arrays using indices.

	- 	Check arrays/assignment work properly.

	-	Implement DIM.

	- 	Why won't XEMU work with RAM < $8000 ? Copying !!!! This is okay for now.

Fixes
=====

- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add Break Check to main RUN loop.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended and 65816
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
-	FP guard byte on subtract ? If so can uprate the floating point equality test.
-	fpch doesn't work in xemu or fm65 modes.

Error Checks
============

- 	Allocating temporary string memory (space available)
- 	Allocating variable space.
