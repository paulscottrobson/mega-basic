TODO
====
	-	Tokeniser and automatic testing.

	- 	direct execution. Set up a "faux program line" with a zero offset
		and a zero line number. When running it check off end of zero offset line ?

	- 	Why won't FM65/XEMU work with RAM < $8000 ? Copying !!!! This is okay for now.
		NEW OLD and Editing will not work (!)

	- 	Code reviews complete.
	
	-	#xxx on INPUT, PRINT, GET, or hooks for it.

	- 	garbage collection/FRE(0) has issues CHR$(42)+FRE(0)+CHR$(43)

	- 	program editing.

	- 	method of setting default type.

	-  	DEF FN make it work ???
									  
	- 	taylor functions. (Can MS copyright constants and known functions....)

	- 	square root N/R or LOG/EXP ? Seperate SQRT ?
			
	-	How will PROC work ? Pre-scan ? Store on search in quasi-type ?

	-	OPEN CLOSE LOAD SAVE ?				

	- 	Add a proper vector for input/print/etc.
							  	
Fixes
=====

- 	Proper insert/delete in line editing.
- 	Add X to Monitor (warm start BASIC)
- 	FP optimisations for 4510 extended and 65816
		- Anything in FPMacros (check XYZ usage for non shifts - may not be worth it)		
		- Integer negation in fputils.asm
		- Mantissa subtraction in fpdivide.asm
-	FP guard byte on subtract ? If so can uprate the floating point equality test.
-	fpch doesn't work in xemu or fm65 modes.

Error Checks
============

LoMem/HiMem crossover :)

- 	Allocating temporary string memory (space available)
- 	Allocating variable space.
- 	Allocating memory space for arrays.
- 	Stack Frame Push.

Updates to multi character tokens
=================================
- 	Syntax checker if any used for this
-	Scan extra table in tokkeyword.asm
- 	Decoding in list.asm
- 	Dispatcher in run.asm
